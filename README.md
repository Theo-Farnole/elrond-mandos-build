## Disclaimer

Attention my dear programmers! I challenged myself by developing this tool as fast as possible during a short evening.
So, the code you will find in this repo is not clean at all.

However, I still put my code at disposal if someone is motivated to continue on his side üòÅ

### Post-mortem

I guess the form design pattern I am using in this project is, in fact, an anti-pattern. I think it would be possible to make something more generic.
